Abstract

Architectural history contains numerous examples of vaulted  structures built using a variety of design techniques and a range of materials, to serve or host different functions. One recurring function is the role of the vault as a roofing element, in part or whole.

Additive manufacturing/3d printing as a new method of construction has been used successfully to construct self-supported load-bearing elements like walls and columns using concrete and clay extrusions. However, with gravity as a limiting factor, the construction of self-supporting horizontal-spanning structures such as roofs or slabs have not quite received the gains of this new technology. The question therefore looms. How can extrudable clay be used within the realms of additive manufacturing/ 3D printing to contribute to the construction of vaulted self-supporting structures that can satisfy the 5th facade requirements?

- This code is developed as part of the project [Rigidity Via Geometry: Embedding Structural Intelligence within 3D Printed Vaulted Structures](https://blog.iaac.net/rigidity-via-geometry-embedding-structural-intelligence-within-3d-printed-vaulted-structures/).
